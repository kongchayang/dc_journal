        <ul class="notes"><u>Notes</u></ul>
            <li>When you define a function, javacript create an object for you that
            has three properites already defined. The name of the function, the lenght which is the number 
            of arguments, and a prototype. You can define a single object, and then have other objects
            inherit from it. The function becomes a regular object.</li>

           <li>Normal Objects: you can assign properties, different variables, and when you do they're passed
            by reference. So that you can run that function from it's new location by just saying the variables
            name and parentheses.</li>
            <li>When you put a function inside of an object, it's typically called a "method." You can run method
           just like any other function by saying object.methodname and then parentheses. </li> 
            <li>Inheritance: child.get() Javascript will look get in child, if child doesn't have get it will
            then search for it from the parent. And it will use the val from child, instead of parent.</li> 
            <li>Every single object has a prototype, execpt for the base object, and any objects you create
            yourself to explicitly to not having prototype.</li>  
            <li>prototype are usually call "classes", and the objects that extend them are "instances."
            A class that extend another class is called a "subclass." Creating an instance is called "instantiation,"
            and you'll notice that there's a two-step process for that. First you create the object by extending the 
            prototype, second you initialize it's data. Instance are about the data, and prototypes are about the methods.</li>
            <li>OOP Allow you to store how your data in a way that nobody else has to worry about.
            You just provide access to that data through your methods, and then if you want to change
            the way the data is store, then you just do it. You can update your methods, and not have to do so 
            to the rest of the program.</li>
        <li>Constructor() is a common method that is used to initialize your objects.</li>
