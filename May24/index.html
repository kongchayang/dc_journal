    KC: The HTML for this one was not valid. You should review the syntax for unordered lists, 
    there were a lot of repetitive, and uneccesary tags.

    Regarding Express, it's a Javascript framework that allows us to create web applications.
    It's basically our server for our web applications. We're able to use that server to develop APIs.

    Node is the V8 Javascript Engine taken out of Chrome, and it allows us to run Javascript server-side, and/or on the command line.
    It does compile down to machine code, but that's a part of the V8 engine by default. Node exposes that to us without needing
    to run the browser.

    I can't disagree with the comment about being snarky. I'm always snarky, :)
