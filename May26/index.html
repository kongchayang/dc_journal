          KC: Watch your HTML formatting, make sure to nest things properly and give the proper heading elements where needed. 
          The Iron Man <-> MVC metaphor is somewhat accurate. 
          A better metaphor would be:
            * Model: Jarvis, the computer in the armor. Jarvis manages the data in and out.
            * View: the Armor itself (regardless of version)
            * Controller: Tony is the controller, he handles input between the armor and everything else
