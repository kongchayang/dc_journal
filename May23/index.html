            Node is Javascript that we can run on the server, or via the command line. It's the javascript
            engine taken from Chrome and made available to us without a browser.

            Node has a lot of modules, we can load them as needed.  In that regard, we can stack modules 
            in Node like we do "Legos" on those flat platforms.

            Walmart used Node for Walmart.com on Black Friday. That event was a big milestone for Node,
            and, in my opinion, was a catalyst for greater adoption. However, Walmart wasn't the first 
            to use Node and be successful. It had been in use in other places previously with a 
            good bit of success.
