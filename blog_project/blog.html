    <h2>Node and Walmart</h2>

    
        <p class="notes">Node is Javascript that we can run on the server, or via the command line. It's the javascript
                engine taken from Chrome and made available to us without a browser.</p>

        <p>Node has a lot of modules, we can load them as needed.  In that regard, we can stack modules 
                in Node like we do "Legos" on those flat platforms.</p>

        <p> Walmart used Node for Walmart.com on Black Friday. That event was a big milestone for Node,
	            and, in my opinion, was a catalyst for greater adoption. However, Walmart wasn't the first 
	            to use Node and be successful. It had been in use in other places previously with a 
                good bit of success.</p>

     <h2>Express</h2>   

        <p class="notes2"> Regarding Express, it's a Javascript framework that allows us to create web applications.
                It's basically our server for our web applications. We're able to use that server to develop APIs.</p>

        <p>Node is the V8 Javascript Engine taken out of Chrome, and it allows us to run Javascript server-side, and/or on the command line.
                It does compile down to machine code, but that's a part of the V8 engine by default. Node exposes that to us without needing
                to run the browser.</p>
